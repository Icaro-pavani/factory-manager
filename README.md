## :clipboard: Description

Factory Manager is a management APP for industries. It is separated into two parts. One for the industry owner, where it is possible to add, edit and delete the users/employees that will have access to the app. The second part is the user/employee area, where the user can add, edit and exclude the industry's units and assets, and can analyze which part of the industry needs maintenance by seeing the graph's area, which shows the health level and status of each asset.
